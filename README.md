# rumor algorithm
Rumor Algorithm is a heuristic algorithm for solving TSP problems (directed and undirected).

It is based on the idea that, experiences of humans in a population effect the decisions of others. Conveying the experiences to the others (rumor) basically makes new decisions positively or negatively biased.

For the min weighted TSP problem setting, experiences are the routes taken and associated total weights of these routes (distance, cost, time etc.) Collection of rumors from humans about their routes (sequence of nodes that form a hamiltonian cycle) and total weight, generates influences.
